# First, a history

--
# The start of a new project

--
# Hope!

--
# Then, add some JS flavor

--
# Single js file

    $(function (){
      // code a lot of stuff here

      var symbol = $('.stock-symbol').val();
      $('form').on('submit', function () {
        // do a lot of stuff
      });

      // more stuff here
    });

--
# Value delivered!
## customer is pleased

--
# Add another feature

--
# and another ...

--
# Megazord JavaScript

--
# Go Horse!

--
# Bugs
## bugs everywhere!

--
# Spaghetti Code
## or: "what have I done?"

--
# We need
## automated testing!

--
# Too little
# Too late

--
## It is not testing that is hard
## It is our code that sux way too much to be tested

--
# So how do we start correctly?

--
# This talk is not about fixing the mess

--
# It is about preventing it
